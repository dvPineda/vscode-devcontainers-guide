## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow the steps below to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository**

   Use the DevContainers command to clone this repository into a container volume:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dvPineda/vscode-devcontainers-guide.git
   ```
2. **Open the repository in a DevContainer**

   Use the command palette (F1) in Visual Studio Code and select `Dev containers: Open Folder in Container...` Then, navigate to the cloned repository.
